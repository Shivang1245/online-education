            <p class="sectionsubtag text-small">India is a developing nation. Although its economy is growing, poverty
                is still a major challenge. However, poverty is on the decline in India. According to an International
                Monetary Fund paper, extreme poverty, defined by the World Bank as living on US$1.9 or less in
                purchasing power parity (PPP) terms, in India was as low as 0.8% in 2019 and the country managed to keep
                it at that level in 2020 despite the unprecedented COVID-19 outbreak. According to World Bank,
                extreme poverty has reduced by 12.3% between 2011 and 2019 from 22.5% in 2011 to 10.2% in 2019. A
                working paper of the bank said rural poverty declined from 26.3% in 2011 to 11.6% in 2019. The decline
                in urban areas was from 14.2% to 6.3% in the same period.The poverty level in rural and urban areas went
                down by 14.7 and 7.9 percentage points, respectively. According to United Nations Development
                Programme administrator Achim Steiner, India lifted 271 million people out of extreme poverty in a
                10-year time period from 2005–2006 to 2015–2016. A 2020 study from the World Economic Forum found "Some
                220 million Indians sustained on an expenditure level of less than Rs 32 / day—the poverty line for
                rural India—by the last headcount of the poor in India in 2013."</p>

            <p class="sectionsubtag text-small">Online learning involves courses offered by primary institutions that
                are 100% virtual. Online learning, or virtual classes offered over the internet, is contrasted with
                traditional courses taken in a brick-and-mortar school building. It is a development in distance
                education that expanded in the 1990s with the spread of the commercial Internet and the World Wide Web.
                The learner experience is typically asynchronous but may also incorporate synchronous elements. The vast
                majority of institutions utilize a learning management system for the administration of online courses.
                As theories of distance education evolve, digital technologies to support learning and pedagogy continue
                to transform as well.</p>

            <p class="sectiontag text-big">Benifits Of Education</p>
            <p class="sectionsubtag text-small">Education is a purposeful activity directed at achieving certain aims,
                such as transmitting knowledge or fostering skills and character traits. These aims may include the
                development of understanding, rationality, kindness, and honesty. Various researchers emphasize the role
                of critical thinking in order to distinguish education from indoctrination. Some theorists require that
                education results in an improvement of the student while others prefer a value-neutral definition of the
                term. In a slightly different sense, education may also refer, not to the process, but to the product of
                this process: the mental states and dispositions possessed by educated people. Education originated as
                the transmission of cultural heritage from one generation to the next. Today, educational goals
                increasingly encompass new ideas such as the liberation of learners, skills needed for modern society,
                empathy, and complex vocational skills.</p>
